I. Introduction

After spending the past year delving into every era of rap music, the intricacies of the genre and its change became extremely intriguing to us. We were interested in quantifying how rap music has evolved over the past 30 years, specifically in regards to its origin, and how that evolution correlates to African-American culture. Specifically, an article, titled "How Polticial Hip-hop Has Evolved Over Time" by Dan Runcie, explains that the style of music was created as a way to express the oppression experience by underrepresented African-Americans. Since then, there's been a wide perception that the themes of systemic racism, police brutality, and generational poverty have fallen out of rap music, so we decided to use deep learning to find a correlation between changes in the content of hip hop and racial injustices.
