Art of Peer Pressure,Kendrick Lamar,Racism,"Now I can't pledge allegiance to your flag Cause I can't find no reconciliation with your past When there was nothing equal for my people in your math You forced us in the ghetto and then you took our dads The belly of the beast, these streets are demons' abs I'm telling you that setup in them sit-ups is so sad The system is a slab, corruption is the swinger Sitting high riding dirty, drag racing into danger And it's so clean, pine trees smelling good With work off in the trunk and niggas in the hood So I can't shed blood on any battlefield of yours I pray the ugly truth comes and shatters your decor And as it all falls down in tatters on the floor I shed tears, I don't know what really matters anymore Cause I don't know what really matters anymore Man it ain't mean, the strangest thing you've ever seen Oh, would you look at how they swing, would you look at how they swing? They ain't dead though, no, I didn't die y'all I cut myself down, and I admire my fall, into grace Now as I wander through the city going mad I see the fruits of planting evidence instead of grass A swindled generation with no patience, full of swag Man, they so impatient with the stations that they have As long as they look good when they be doing bad Then the separation from the truth is getting vast, fast Be a slave at first or free at last Double-edged choices make a nigga wanna pass Double-headed voices from the eagle on the staff The pyramid where eyes will split the spirited in half Divided over money, delighted by the dummying Down of the importance of crowns we'll never have That's why my sounds and sermons are so full of wrath Baptize your mind, let your brain take a bath Swim inside the river get delivered from the craft Of the witches in this business that be living off your sad Hating on your happiness you hit 'em off with laughs Smile 'til they surrender, then you kill 'em off with glad Hello evil, I'm back Man it ain't mean, the strangest thing you've ever seen Oh, would you look at how they swing, would you look at how they swing? They ain't dead though, no, I didn't die y'all I cut myself down, and I admire my fall, into grace"

Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment Some of us scared, some of us defensive And most of us aren't even paying attention It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist Than we actually are with racism I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue Actually looked at myself, actually got involved? If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know Hip-hop has always been political, yes It's the reason why this music connects So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying Then I'm trying to be politically correct? I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets Rap entrepreneur, built his own business If I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with Then this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick The DIY underdog, so independent But the one thing the American dream fails to mention Is I was many steps ahead to begin with My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image America feels safe with my music in their systems And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho White supremacy protects the privilege I hold White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson â€“ guilty We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn't show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter. They would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because that's the house that needs the help the most. â€” My generation's taken on the torch of a very age-old fight for black liberation, but also liberation for everyone. Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. â€” The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members. â€” I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?'

Babe Ruth woulda made a good cop, but he didn't Instead he was a bigot, dig it My life is valuable and I protect it like a gem Instead of cops gettin me I'm goin out gettin them And let em cough up blood like phlegm It's grim [blam blam] but dead is my antonym And legally they can't take a fall Yo check it out it's just a friendly game of baseball R.B.I. -- real bad injury But don't get happy you're in jail for a century Just as bad as bein shot in the groin To see who'll shoot ya, they'll flip a coin And watch him run for the stretch But you don't know the man is at home waitin to make the catch So the outfielder guns you down You're out, off to the dugout, underground I know a cop that's savage, his pockets stay green like cabbage Cause he has a good batting average No questions, just pulls out the flamer [blam] And his excuses get lamer Once a brother tried to take a leave But they shot him in his face sayin he was tryin to steal a base And people watch the news for coverage on the game Hmm, and got the nerve to complain They need to get themselves a front row seat Or sink a baseline for a beat Cause television just ain't designed for precision y'all It's just a friendly game of baseball A kid caught on, but I don't know where the brother went The umpires are the government I guess they took him out the game, and replace him with a pinch-hitter, in the scam he was a quitter So the cops usually torment, I mean tournament Win em I was sayin You can't let the umpires, hear ya speak and battle like the other kid you won't be playin Cause they'll beat you til your ass drop A walking gun with a shell in his hand is their mascot And when they walk around let it be known to step lightly The bases are loaded My man got out from three strikes In the skull but the knife he was carrying was dull Instead of innings, we have endings What a fine way to win things And hot-dog vendors have fun Sellin you the cat rat and dog on a bun And when you ask what is all of this called? It's just a friendly game of baseball"

Put in the basement of a prison wit all males And the smell of misery, seat-less toilets and centipedes She'd exercise, (paint?, ) and begin to read Two years in a hole. Her soul grew weak Away from people so long she forgot how to speak She discovered freedom is a unspoken sound And a wall is a wall and can be broken down Found peace in the Panthers she went on trial with One of the brothers she had a child with The foulness they would feed her, hopin she's lose her seed Held tight, knowing the fight would live through this seed In need of a doctor, from her stomach she's bleed Out of this situation a girl was conceived Separated from her, left to mother the Revolution And lactated to attack hate Cause federal and state was built for a Black fate Her emptiness was filled with beatings and court dates They fabricated cases, hoping one would stick And said she robbed places that didn't exist In the midst of threats on her life and being caged with Aryan whites Through dark halls of hate she carried the light I wonder what would happen if that would of been me? All of this shit so we could be free. Yeah, I often wonder what would happen if that would f been me? All of this shit so we could be free, so dig it, people I'm thinkin' of Assata, yes Listen to my Love, Assata, yes Your Power and Pride is beautiful May God bless your Soul Yo From North Carolina her grandmother would bring News that she had had a dream Her dreams always meant what they needed them to mean What made them real was the action in between She dreamt that Assata was free in they old house in Queens The fact that they always came true was the thing Assata had been convicted of a murder she couldna done Medical evidence shown she couldna shot the gun It's time for her to see the sun from the other side Time for her daughter to be by her mother's side Time for this Beautiful Woman to become soft again Time for her to breathe, and not be told how or when She untangled the chains and escaped the pain How she broke out of prison I could never explain And even to this day they try to get to her But she's free with political asylum in Cuba.
