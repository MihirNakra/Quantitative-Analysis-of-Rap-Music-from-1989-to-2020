Wishing for a Hero,Polo G,Racism,"Well respected in this hip-hop, lil' Polo be spittin' facts A lot of rappers doin' way more stuntin' than givin' back You ain't my color, then you don't know the struggle of livin' black Cops kill us and we protest, what type of shit is that? Man, if the police shoot at one of my brothers, I'm blickin' back We hate each other, so we just wanna score and go tit-for-tat All these shorties want is points, they ain't chasin' a different stat Really riskin' it all, what's the point when that nigga rat? We 17, got 40 years in that court when we gettin' cracked Stuck in the system They just watchin' us fail while they sittin' back The government cuttin' checks, but can't cut a nigga some slack It's hard to get a job, so we hustle and flip a pack It's all a set-up, no wonder why they call this bitch a trap Life was messed up, a matter of time 'til that nigga snap Post-traumatic stress, so them triggers keep gettin' tapped R.I.P. Malcolm, I promise to conquer and fill them gaps Them corners leave a nigga boxed in, tryna break free Crazy how I love the same block that tried to break me Pray that I ain't in my own hood when they take me This all we know, a life of peace what we can't see I'm from where we unheard and we can't speak We go to school, they try to tell us what we can't be Profit with a billion-dollar mind like I'm Jay-Z They killed Martin for dreamin' and now I can't sleep Why would the devil take my brother if he close to me? Now if you scared, take my soul, you see my bros in me We missin' you, man, this ain't how this shit supposed to be Feel like I'm stuck, I wish them streets never proposed to me Out there posted in the field with them soldiers deep So now the other side wanna put a hole in me Like every day might be the end of the road for me We die young, so I couldn't picture a older me Fightin' demons, let them drugs take control of me All in my head, go and kill what they told to me 'Member we ain't have a thing, same clothes for weeks Hardbody, that's how them situations molded me Needed money and grew accustomed to this fast life Pressure from this way of livin', so we blast pipes Shit got me stressin' 365 nights Them people workin' against us like we don't have rights It don't matter what this money and this fame can give I've been hurtin', tryna smile through the pain and tears Wish we could go back to them days when we played as kids A lot of shit changed, that's just the way it is"
Changes,2Pac,Racism,"Come on, come on I see no changes, wake up in the morning, and I ask myself Is life worth living, should I blast myself? I'm tired of bein' poor, and even worse I'm black My stomach hurts, so I'm lookin' for a purse to snatch Cops give a damn about a negro Pull the trigger, kill a nigga, he's a hero Give the crack to the kids who the hell cares One less hungry mouth on the welfare First, ship 'em dope and let 'em deal the brothers Give 'em guns, step back, watch 'em kill each other It's time to fight back, that's what Huey said Two shots in the dark, now Huey's dead I got love for my brother, but we can never go nowhere Unless we share with each other We gotta start makin' changes Learn to see me as a brother instead of two distant strangers And that's how it's supposed to be How can the devil take a brother, if he's close to me? I'd love to go back to when we played as kids But things changed, and that's the way it is Come on, come on That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is Ooh, yeah Come on, come on That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is Aww, yeah I see no changes, all I see is racist faces Misplaced hate makes disgrace to races We under, I wonder what it takes to make this One better place, let's erase the wasted Take the evil out the people, they'll be acting right 'Cause mo' black and white is smokin' crack tonight And only time we chill is when we kill each other It takes skill to be real, time to heal each other And although it seems heaven sent We ain't ready, to see a black President It ain't a secret, don't conceal the fact The penitentiary's packed, and it's filled with blacks But some things will never change Try to show another way but you stayin' in the dope game Now tell me, what's a mother to do? Bein' real don't appeal to the brother in you You gotta operate the easy way (I made a G today) But you made it in a sleazy way Sellin' crack to the kid (I gotta get paid) Well, hey, well, that's the way it is Come on, come on That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is Aww, yeah Come on, come on That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is Aww, yeah We gotta make a change It's time for us as a people to start makin' some changes Let's change the way we eat Let's change the way we live And let's change the way we treat each other You see, the old way wasn't working so it's on us to do What we gotta do, to survive And still I see no changes, can't a brother get a little peace? There's war in the streets and war in the Middle East Instead of war on poverty, they got a war on drugs So the police can bother me And I ain't never did a crime, I ain't have to do But now, I'm back with the facts givin' 'em back to you Don't let 'em jack you up, back you up Crack you up and pimps smack you up You gotta learn to hold ya own They get jealous when they see ya, with ya mobile phone But tell the cops, they can't touch this I don't trust this, when they try to rush, I bust this That's the sound of my tool, you say it ain't cool? But mama didn't raise no fool And as long as I stay black, I gotta stay strapped And I never get to lay back 'Cause I always got to worry 'bout the pay backs Some buck that I roughed up way back Comin' back after all these years Rat-a-tat, tat, tat, tat, that's the way it is That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is (Way it is) Aww, yeah That's just the way it is Things will never be the same That's just the way it is Aww, yeah Some things will never change"

Black America Again,Common,Racism,"Here we go, here, here we go again Trayvon'll never get to be an older man Black children, they childhood stole from them Robbed of our names and our language, stole again Who stole the soul from black folk? Same man that stole the land from Chief Black Smoke And made the whip crackle on our back slow And made us go through the back door And raffle black bodies on the slave blocks Now we slave to the blocks, on 'em we spray shots Leaving our own to lay in a box Black mothers' stomachs stay in a knot We kill each other, it's part of the plot I wish the hating will stop (war!) and the battle with us I know that Black Lives Matter, and they matter to us These are the things we gotta discuss The new plantation, mass incarceration Instead of educate, they'd rather convict the kids As dirty as the water in Flint, the system is Is it a felony or a misdemeanor? Maria Sharapova making more than Serena It took Viola Davis to say this The roles of the help and the gangstas is really all they gave us We need Avas, Ta-Nehisis, and Cory Bookers The salt of the Earth to get us off of sugar And greasy foods; I don't believe the news Or radio, stereotypes we refuse Brainwashed in the cycle to spin We write our own story, black America again You know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is lettin' a person feel that they're important. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from… Hot damn, black America again Think of Sandra Bland as I'm staring in the wind The color of my skin, they comparing it to sin The darker it gets, the less fairer it has been The hate the hate made, I inherited from them But I ain't gon' point the finger We got anointed singers, like Nina, Marvin, Billie, Stevie Need to hear them songs sometimes to believe me Who freed me: Lincoln or Cadillac? Drinkin' or battle raps? Or is it Godspeed that we travel at? Endangered in our own habitat The guns and dope, man, y'all can have it back As a matter of fact, we them lab rats You build the projects for, now you want your hood back I guess if you could rap, you would express it too That PTSD, we need professionals You know what pressure do, it make the pipes bust From schools to prison, y'all, they tryna pipe us Tell your political parties invite us Instead of making voting laws to spite us You know, you know we from a family of fighters Fought in your wars and our wars You put a nigga in Star Wars, maybe you need two And then, maybe then we'll believe you See black people in the future We wasn't shipped here to rob and shoot ya We hold these truths to be self-evident All men and women are created equal Including black Americans You know, you know, you know, one way of solving a lot of problems that we've got is to let a person feel like somebody. And a man can't get himself together until he knows who he is, and be proud of what and who he is and where he come from, and where he come from… We are rewriting the black American story We are rewriting the black American story"

Reagan,Killer Mike,Racism,"Our government has a firm policy not to capitulate to terrorist demands That no-concessions policy remains in force Despite the wildly speculative and false stories about arms for hostages And alleged ransom payments, we did not, repeat Did not trade weapons or anything else for hostages, nor will we The ballot or the bullet, some freedom or some bullshit Will we ever do it big, or just keep settlin' for li'l shit? We brag on having bread, but none of us are bakers We all talk having greens, but none of us own acres If none of us own acres, and none of us grow wheat Then who will feed our people when our people need to eat? So it seems our people starve from lack of understanding 'Cause all we seem to give them is some ballin' and some dancin' And some talkin' about our car and imaginary mansions We should be indicted for bullshit we inciting Handin' children death and pretendin' it's excitin' We are advertisements for agony and pain We exploit the youth, we tell them to join a gang We tell them dope stories, introduce them to the game Just like Oliver North introduced us to cocaine In the 80s when the bricks came on military planes A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true But the facts and the evidence tell me it is not The end of the Reagan Era, I'm like 'leven, twelve, or Old enough to understand that shit'd changed forever They declared the war on drugs, like a war on terror But what it really did was let the police terrorize whoever But mostly black boys, but they would call us ""niggers"" And lay us on our belly, while they fingers on they triggers They boots was on our head, they dogs was on our crotches And they would beat us up if we had diamonds on our watches And they would take our drugs and moneys, as they pick our pockets I guess that that's the privilege of policin' for some profits But thanks to Reaganomics, prison turned to profits 'Cause free labor's the cornerstone of US economics 'Cause slavery was abolished, unless you are in prison You think I am bullshittin', then read the 13th Amendment Involuntary servitude and slavery it prohibits That's why they givin' drug offenders time in double digits Ronald Reagan was a actor, not at all a factor Just an employee of the country's real masters Just like the Bushes, Clinton, and Obama Just another talking head telling lies on teleprompters If you don't believe the theory, then argue with this logic Why did Reagan and Obama both go after Qaddafi? We invaded sovereign soil, going after oil Taking countries is a hobby paid for by the oil lobby Same as in Iraq and Afghanistan And Ahmadinejad say they coming for Iran They only love the rich, and how they loathe the poor If I say any more they might be at my door (Shh...)

There's no way for you to even that out You can join the march, protest, scream and shout But they see through it all, people believe you now? You said publicly, ""Rest in peace, Mike Brown"" You speak about equality, but do you really mean it? Are you marching for freedom, or when it's convenient?

Yeah, like, all the guns and the drugs The bitches and the hoes and the gangs and the thugs Even the protest outside, so sad, and so dumb If a cop pulls you over, it's your fault if you run Huh?

(laughs) No. — See, more people nowadays are just pussies. Like, this is the generation to be offended by everything. — 'Black Lives Matter' thing is a reason to take arms up over perceived slights. — I'm not prejudiced, I just... — 99% of the time, across this country, the police are doing their job properly. Damn, a lot of opinions, a lot of confusion, a lot of resentment Some of us scared, some of us defensive And most of us aren't even paying attention It seems like we're more concerned with being called racist Than we actually are with racism I've heard that silences are action and God knows that I've been passive What if I actually read a article, actually had a dialogue Actually looked at myself, actually got involved? If I'm aware of my privilege and do nothing at all, I don't know Hip-hop has always been political, yes It's the reason why this music connects So what the fuck has happened to my voice if I stay silent when black people are dying Then I'm trying to be politically correct? I can book a whole tour, sell out the tickets Rap entrepreneur, built his own business If I'm only in this for my own self-interest, not the culture that gave me a voice to begin with Then this isn't authentic, it is just a gimmick The DIY underdog, so independent But the one thing the American dream fails to mention Is I was many steps ahead to begin with My skin matches the hero, likeness, the image America feels safe with my music in their systems And it's suited me perfect, the role, I've fulfilled it And if I'm the hero, you know who gets cast as the villain White supremacy isn't just a white dude in Idaho White supremacy protects the privilege I hold White supremacy is the soil, the foundation, the cement and the flag that flies outside of my home White supremacy is our country's lineage, designed for us to be indifferent My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson – guilty We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? We want to dress like, walk like, talk like, dance like, yet we just stand by We take all we want from black culture, but will we show up for black lives? Black Lives Matter, to use an analogy, is like if... if there was a subdivision and a house was on fire. The fire department wouldn't show up and start putting water on all the houses because all houses matter. They would show up and they would turn their water on the house that was burning because that's the house that needs the help the most. — My generation's taken on the torch of a very age-old fight for black liberation, but also liberation for everyone. Injustice anywhere is still injustice everywhere. — The best thing white people can do is talk to each other, having those very difficult, very painful conversations with your parents, with your family members. — I think one of the critical questions for white people in this society is, 'What are you willing to risk? What are you willing to sacrifice to create a more just society?' Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury Your silence is a luxury, hip-hop is not a luxury What I got for me, it is for me What we made, we made to set us free What I got for me, it is for me What we made, we made to set us free What I got for me, it is for me What we made, we made to set us free"
